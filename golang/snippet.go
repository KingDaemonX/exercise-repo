		result += i

/*
First issue identified is that the function name is not consistent.
The function name is printFactorial() in the function definition but printfactorial() in the main function.
The function name in the main function should be printFactorial() to match the function definition.

second identified is the result definition in the factorial function is a float64 type while the n argument is a int type.
also the return type of the function is int while the result is float64 type, which is not consistent and will cause a compilation error.

The result variable should be an int type and the return type of the function should be float64 to match the result variable type.

Also the factorial function is not calculating the factorial of the number correctly.
The result variable should be initialized to 1 and then multiplied by the loop variable i in each iteration to calculate the factorial of the number.

The required code correction should be as follows:

result := 1
for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
	result *= i
}
return result


in the main function, the function called should be printFactorial() instead of printfactorial().
